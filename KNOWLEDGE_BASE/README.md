# KNOWLEDGE BASE SYSTEM

## Purpose
This knowledge base preserves discoveries, solutions, and domain expertise across AI sessions. No more re-explaining the same things!

## Structure

## Usage Workflow

### When Starting a New Project
1. Reference relevant knowledge base files
2. Confirm what's applicable to current project
3. Identify gaps that need new research
4. Build on existing solutions

### When Discovering Something New
1. Document the discovery immediately
2. Add to appropriate knowledge base file
3. Include context, examples, and gotchas
4. Date the entry for tracking

### File Update Protocol
- **Immediate updates** when solving problems
- **Include failure cases** - what didn't work and why
- **Date entries** for tracking learning progression
- **Link related concepts** across files
- **Monthly reviews** to clean outdated info

## Benefits
✅ **No more re-explaining** - Knowledge accumulates over time
✅ **Faster project starts** - AI knows your domain expertise immediately
✅ **Consistent solutions** - Reuse what works
✅ **Learning progression** - Build on previous discoveries
✅ **Cross-project benefits** - Knowledge from one project helps others

## Quick Reference Commands
- "I'm starting a new [DOMAIN] project" - Reference knowledge base
- "Should I add this to the knowledge base?" - Document new discoveries
- "Update knowledge base" - Add new information to relevant files
